This User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Plan is designed to verify that the **PO & Contract Review Application** meets all business requirements and functions correctly within your Windows Server/AD environment.

---

## 1. UAT Strategy & Scope

The goal is to simulate real-world scenarios, from task creation to the final "Golden PO" archival. Testing will be performed by representatives from **Customer Service**, **Technical Review**, and **Commercial/Legal** roles.

---

## 2. Test Scenarios & Scripts

### Scenario A: Workflow Initiation & Role Assignment

* **Test Case:** Customer Service initiates a new PO review.
* **Expected Result:** * System allows file upload to the secure Windows File Share.
* Initiator can assign specific AD users to Technical and Commercial roles.
* Workflow status changes to "Reviewing".
* SMTP notification is sent to all assigned approvers.



### Scenario B: Parallel Approval & Electronic Sign-off

* **Test Case:** Parallel reviewers (Technical and Commercial) perform sign-offs.
* **Expected Result:** * Both users can access the document simultaneously.
* Electronic sign-off captures AD Username, Date, and Timestamp.
* Audit trail logs both actions independently.



### Scenario C: Exception Management & "HOLD" Logic

* **Test Case:** Reviewer finds a discrepancy and triggers a HOLD.
* **Expected Result:** * The system flags the workflow with a "HOLD" status on the dashboard.
* An email notification is sent to the initiator.
* The "HOLD" remains active until a new version of the "Golden PO" is uploaded.



### Scenario D: Rejection & Correction Queue

* **Test Case:** A reviewer rejects a contract.
* **Expected Result:** * Status changes to "Rejected".
* All participants in the workflow receive a rejection email.
* The item appears in the "Correction Queue" on the dashboard for Customer Service.



### Scenario E: Aging Reminders & System Parameters

* **Test Case:** A task sits idle past the first threshold (e.g., 2 days).
* **Expected Result:** * The background service identifies the aging task based on system parameters.
* A reminder email is sent to the pending approver.
* The dashboard updates the "Reminder Level" visual indicator.
